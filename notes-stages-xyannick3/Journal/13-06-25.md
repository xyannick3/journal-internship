morning 
Today I've made an exercise using the `json` file I've generated using my parser. 
for now it's not that functional although it does work but it showcases how the json format can be used to load a large amount of exercices

It mostly works, this afternoon I'll try to find ways to fix the issues of syntax, for some reasons some things get displayed some others do not. 

afternoon 
I found some ways of fixing some of the issues although I believe most of it will end up being just "welp certainly the teacher would not use that specific LaTeX Macro which doesn't work on a web app :)". Because I don't think I can like find ways to fix the problems the web app has. I should probably try to detect theses tags and delete them that could work too. 
after this I'll try to do an alternative parser or completing this one to work with the source files of exo7

next week I'll try to fix the issues I've identified as well as implementing some of the other features I've been asked to do such as the kitz to image convertion
