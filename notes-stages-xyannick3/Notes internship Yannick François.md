Under this is the internship notes of Yannick Fran√ßois contributing to the Platon project

Why English : I'm using Obsidian to organize my notes, unfortunately whoever made this didn't think anyone would need to have the spell check be something different from the system language. Since it's more practical to have English as a system language and it's not practical at all to have every 2 words detected as a spelling mistake I'll write in English.
