- First step : learning how to execute the code of a student recovered from `wc-code-editor`. So my first task is to get familiar with how to manipulate this component.

- we assume the student knows basic algorithms and python.

- we might do questions about theories such as "what does the builder section", "what does the grader section", "what's the name of the variable used to recover the grade", "how to display a feedback"

- make exercises about components, by using code input and execution of code.
