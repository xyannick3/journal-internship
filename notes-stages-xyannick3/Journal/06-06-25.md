today I've made a template `.ple` to make the creation of exercises faster and more organised. 

I've played a bit with the `wc-code-editor` as well as the `wc-code-viewer` to display the expected solution. However I've noticed that the `wc-code-viewer` is broken. The issue was already raised a year ago so ig it's ongoing. 

Instead I'm using markdown display. Which in practice works the same but just doesn't really have that terminal look to it.
