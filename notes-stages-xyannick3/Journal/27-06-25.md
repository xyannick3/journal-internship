Morning 

I'm finalizing the template to turn internally a tex into an exercice


I've finished it and I've made 2 prototypes each using the template.

I tried having Thibault use the template and he was a little confused so I mage a developped documentation around it. 

I think I'm nearing the end of this task. 

I'll fix the prototypes of the other questions later.
