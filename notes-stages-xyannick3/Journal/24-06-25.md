Morning, I've identified and fixed the "bug" in the exercise 10. The source of the issue is that if MathLive uncounters something like $\frac12$  it does not return it as \frac{1}{2}. It instead returns `\frac12`. Which while correct is not simple to deal with. To deal with this re parsing the return of MathLive is probably the easiest way to deal with the issue. 

update, the bug has been fixed.

I'm going to go back into working on my parser. I'm going to redo the documentation and try to fix the presentation and some bugs.

for some reasons shoriz is broken again, amma try to fix it. 

I made a typo, fixed now. 

I fixed an issue with texttt.

I still need to fix an issue with the columns.

I think to fix my comment issue I might just read the file before parsing to remove absolutely all the comments, would make the code way more consistent and easier to work with. 

I fixed the issue with the comments by removing every comments before parsing, I'm going to need to remove all the things made to remove comments after parsing tho so that's going to take a short while
