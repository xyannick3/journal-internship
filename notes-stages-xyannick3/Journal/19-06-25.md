morning 
I'm going to make a platon example as well as fixing the previous example. 

I fixed a problem with the commands with several arguments not being fully deleted 

afternoon, I'm going to refactor my code a little

I'm in the afternoon I'm currently refactoring the code, I need to learn how to use match to do more complicated things 

I downloaded the exo7 repo and I'm going to make a second parser that does things in a different way.

```tex
$(1 + i)(2 + i)=-1 + 3i$

  

\begin{reponses}

\mauvaise{Vrai}

\bonne{Faux}

\end{reponses}

  

\begin{comment}

Le produit vaut $1 + 3i$

\end{comment}
```
here we can see the exo7 exercises have an instruction

some responses

and possibly a comment that's an indication after the answer if it's negative I guess?

```json
{
	comment: string,
	question: string,
	response: {
		content: string,
		correct: boolean, 
		alafin?: boolean
	}
}
```

I'm thinking about two mods of usage, a singular one which just turns one tex file into one json, another that takes all the tex files in a repertory and turns them into a massive json of exercices
