today I'm going to work to make it that exo7 scan gets a result similar to the other.

I've standardised the output of reading exo7. and I've made it so that both things can be read properly. 

next I need to experiment with storing the images in the dictionary itself. Since the end goal is to be able to put it in Platon, it would be good to not need to interact with any file.
