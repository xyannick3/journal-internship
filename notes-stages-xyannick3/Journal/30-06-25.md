Morning,

Today I'm working a bit on making the code more readable as well as making the Parser more smart. 

I removed some legacy functions that I no longer use. adding a bit of documentation yadayadayada. 

I'll have to make researches as to how to import an image 

I'll have to use `\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{image.jpg}`

To do that I need : 
- To implement a way to detect if `\includegraphics` has been called, then call something else that processes the content.
- To be able to locate the image (probably will need to keep the directory in which the `.tex` file was found)
- To turn the image into a base64 file and integrate it as any other type of media. 
- To filter out `\includegraphics` from the displayed content. 

- Problem Platon to solve : 
	- We would need to be able to dynamically import the other images media
	- or alternatively 


- Revuz sidequest : He wants to have a py file that allows to compile the tekz files. in a `.py`. For the electronicians to use.
