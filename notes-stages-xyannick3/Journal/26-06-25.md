Morning,

Yesterday I tried to integrate the parser, I'm facing a wall due to my parser using syntax that only the most recent versions of Python accept. 

I've managed to make the changes so that the code compiles
However pdflatex has issues working on the sandbox for uh reasons 
Afternoon : 

Thomas fixed it I'm going to be able to get back to it 

It's fixed and should work now.
