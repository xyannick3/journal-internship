The first day of the internship,

In the morning we went over how Platon work as well as beginning to install Platon to begin working on it. 

In the afternoon we continued to install Platon, then we discussed more about what we could do as our missions. 

proposed missions : 
- [[missions/browse templates| browse templates to look for possible upgrades and understanding on what makes a good template]]
- [[training to make an exercise template]]
- [[trying to have Platon run on IDX]]

For now I've tried to work on using IDX. Tomorrow I aim to continue working on IDX but I want to mainly begin working on exercises at it is the main topic of my mission.
