Today I realized a template using textSelect to familiarize myself with the creation of new templates. 

I mainly struggled getting my parser working (not my proudest moment). 

But I think I mostly understand how these works now and I've made a fairly functional template. 

tomorrow I'll implement regex with a toggle and I think I'll call it a day on that exercise
